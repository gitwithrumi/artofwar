            - Unless you plan to do in-app purchases, you should save gems to
            obtain heroes.
            <br />

            - For new players, the wheel of fortune is a good way of obtain
            heroes. With the wheel of fortune, a player can obtain a hero shard
            for an average cost of 2,100 gems. The wheel also allows the player
            to obtain useful rare/epic hero and troops.
            <br />
            - The second best way of obtaining a legendary hero is play Card
            Master, where the average cost is 2,700 gems per shard.
            <br />
            - Do not use gems to open hero chests.
            <br />
            - Do not use gems to open super card packs. Only use vouchers for
            those.
            <br />
            - Do not use gems to buy troops.
            <br />
            - Do not use gems on temple of fusion until you have a high-level
            legendary hero.

          <div class="tips-answer" id="answer3">
            - The main strategy to pass a hard level and defend in the arena is
            to increase your army soldier counter by using multi-load troops
            that load 9 units instead of single load troops. No matter how
            strong a single load troop is (with exception to demons and golems
            who are incredibly strong) multi-load troops are stronger because 9
            soldiers combined typically have higher stats than a single load
            troop.
            <br />
            - Use undead soldiers (they revive once during a battle), assassins
            and apprentices (they are fast to kill enemies in the back row),
            paladins (they have the highest combined HP and can shield friendly
            troops), harbingers of fire (who are high DPS troops that deal AoE
            damage) and archers (who deal ranged DPS damage).
            <br />
            - Fortify your first row to make it as durable as possible (if you
            want to know why just ask us).

          <div class="tips-question">Front Line Strategy ‚ò£Ô∏è</div>
          <div class="tips-answer" id="answer4">
            Stone Golems, Rhino Knights, Pumpkin Guards, Sacred Swordsmen, and
            Meteor Golems are hard to kill troops for the front row. Please
            choose one or two of them to attract attention, and until they die,
            your enemy won't turn and defend their backline. If you don't have a
            good Stone Golem or Rhino Knights, other tanks can be used, but a 9
            or 10 Stone Golem or Rhino Knight is probably your best option.
            <br />
            The rest of row one should be Magic Apprentices, Ghost Assassins, or
            Demons, which can't be targeted because they fly or blink away.
            Doing this ensures that the durable tank you set out is the targeted
            troop.
            <br />
            Do not use 9-load melee or ranged troops. As soon as any of those
            dies, whatever was targeting those will retarget. The goal is to
            keep enemy troops busy for as long as possible
            <br />
            Putting zero targetable troops in the first row simply means that
            all the troops will target the troops in the second row so always
            have a high level strong tank in first row like SS MG

          <div class="tips-question">Back Line Defensive Strategy üîô</div>
          <div class="tips-answer" id="answer5">
            An important key to winning in the arena is building a strong
            backline defence. We will look at the keys to successfully guard the
            rear of your formation. This guide is about how to set up the back
            row or two last lines of your formation. Before reading it, check
            out our guide on Front Line Strategy. Even if you don't have a good
            front line, a good backline will protect you too.
            <br />
            Good Backline defenders can take a long time to build.
            <br />
            Good troops for a backline are generally: Stone Golems, Pirate
            Ships, Pumpkin Guards, Undeads, Voodoo Dolls, and Goblikazies.
            <br />
            The best troops vary by the hero you use. Nuns are great for Selene,
            and Brawlers are great for Arthur due to their specific boosts. But,
            great defensive troops can take a while to build to high levels.
            <br />
            You have to use the troops you have until you have the troops you
            want. <br />
            Paladins and Cactus can be good beginner defensive troops until you
            build up Undead Soldiers. <br />
            Undead Soldiers are better than Paladins because they die, then
            respawn and retarget.
            <br />
            Paladins often die before turning around. Beast Masters, Witchcraft
            Totems, and Soul Hunters can take the place of Pumpkin Guards until
            high-level units can be build
